This is a ReadMe file for analysis files.

[1] Notational changes

To aid either the reading of the main paper or to aid derivations, some notational changes are made between the main paper 
and the python files, notebooks and txt files.

p_pair: This is used in place of 1 - p[pref] (from the main text) to simplify algebra in the python and txt files

ppc: This corresponds to p[cp] in the main text.
pmp: This corresponds to p[pm] in the main text.
pdm: This corresponds to p[md] in the main text.

vp: This is v' in the main text.
qp: This is q' in the main text.
rp: This is r' in the main text.

p_0: This is p[0] in the main text.
p_1: This is p[1] in the main text.

[2] Fig-X-Y .ipynb files, where X equals the figure number and Y a short abbreviated description

These are python notebooks that generated figures 5 - 7.

[3] Table-1 files

This is a representative python script that generated the results for the statistical estimation of rates of synaptic
partner switches and preferential cross-over formation.  The transition matrix file for the representative case is 
also provided.  The case is for a GGgg parent, p[switch] = 0.25, p[pref] = 0.50, distal locus and n = 50,000.
